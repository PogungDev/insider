# INSIDER - Sei Blockchain Analytics Platform

## How This Meets Tooling Track Goals

INSIDER is a comprehensive blockchain analytics platform designed specifically for the Sei ecosystem, addressing the key requirements of the Tooling & Infrastructure Track:

### 1. Sei-native Integration ✅
- **Direct RPC Integration**: Real-time connection to Sei blockchain via WebSocket
- **On-chain Event Monitoring**: Live tracking of token unlocks, transfers, and DeFi interactions
- **Sei-specific Analytics**: Specialized insights for Sei token economics and ecosystem patterns
- **Native Asset Support**: Full support for SEI, USDC, ATOM, and other Sei ecosystem tokens

### 2. Monitoring & Alerts ✅
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered detection of whale movements, volume spikes, and suspicious activities, including rugpull indicators like high token accumulation in developer wallets (e.g., if dev holds >30% of supply, flagged as high risk).
- **Token Unlock Calendar**: Comprehensive tracking with countdown timers, impact analysis, and post-unlock dump probability based on historical data (e.g., 90% dump chance in bullish markets for fake vestings).
- **Multi-channel Alerts**: Telegram, Discord, and Email notifications for critical events, including warnings for potential rugpulls and unlock impacts.
- **Custom Alert Rules**: User-defined thresholds for personalized monitoring, such as alerting on dev wallet accumulations exceeding 20% of total supply.

### 3. Behavior Analysis & Insights ✅
- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: AI-powered wallet behavior classification (DeFi farmer, HODLer, arbitrageur) with added rugpull risk assessment based on token distribution patterns.
- **Spending Heatmaps**: Temporal activity analysis showing peak trading hours and patterns, highlighting unusual dev wallet activities.
- **Token Distribution Analysis**: Portfolio composition, diversification scoring, and dev accumulation checks to identify unsafe tokens.
- **Whale Transfer Visualization**: Interactive plots tracking large value movements, with filters for dev-related transfers.

### 4. Investment Strategy / AI ✅
- **AI-powered Recommendations**: GPT-4 powered investment advice based on wallet behavior
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk scoring with confidence intervals
- **Strategy Intelligence**: Predictive analysis for upcoming token unlocks
- **Interactive AI Chat**: Real-time blockchain insights and strategy consultation

### 5. Tooling / SDK Value ✅
- **Comprehensive SDK**: Full TypeScript SDK for developers to integrate analytics
- **REST API**: Well-documented endpoints for data access and real-time monitoring
- **Reusable Components**: React components for blockchain data visualization
- **Developer Tools**: CLI tools and utilities for blockchain data analysis
